Project Description
This repository contains statistical analysis scripts used in the study of associations between blood cell markers and depression status based on repeated physical examination records.
Data: This dataset includes repeated measurements from participants undergoing routine health check-ups. Each row represents one visit by a participant.

Key variables include:
Variable	Description
dah           	Unique identifier for each participant. All rows with the same dah refer to repeat visits by the same individual.
jcsj	          Examination date (timestamp) of the physical check-up.
status        	Binary indicator of depression diagnosis status at the next visit: typically coded as 0 = no depression, 1 = depression.
class         	Ordinal categorical variable indicating depression severity at the next visit, with levels: no depression, mild, moderate, and severe.
Other columns 	Include blood cell parameters and derived ratios (e.g., PLR, MLR, NLR), demographic data, and health behaviors (e.g., smoking, drinking).
â€ƒ
indicator file (e.g., indicator_name.xlsx)
This file contains a list of biomarker variables analyzed in the study. 
Columns typically include:
â€¢	Indicator name in Chinese
â€¢	English translation (optional)
â€¢	Abbreviations (e.g., PLR = Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio)
â€¢	Units (if applicable)
ðŸ§ª Analysis Overview
The scripts in this repository perform the following types of analyses:
â€¢	Poisson regression: Used to model incidence rate and calculate dispersion statistics.
â€¢	Mixed-effects models: Account for within-person correlation in repeated measures.
â€¢	Logistic regression: Association of biomarkers with binary depression status.
â€¢	Ordinal Logistic regression: Associations with depression severity.
â€¢	Trajectory modeling: Latent class modeling to identify longitudinal biomarker patterns over time.
